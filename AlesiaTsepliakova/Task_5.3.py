# Task 5.3
# File data/students.csv stores information about students in CSV format. This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.

# 1. Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students
# def get_top_performers(file_path, number_of_top_students=5):
#     pass

# print(get_top_performers("students.csv"))
# >>> ['Teresa Jones', 'Richard Snider', 'Jessica Dubose', 'Heather Garcia', 'Joseph Head']
# 2. Implement a function which receives the file path with srudents info and writes CSV student information to the new file in descending order of age. Result:
# student name,age,average mark
# Verdell Crawford,30,8.86
# Brenda Silva,30,7.53
# ...
# Lindsey Cummings,18,6.88
# Raymond Soileau,18,7.27
